Mock tape-out of the 60 GHz demonstrator chip, as part of 2022 IEEE SSCS Chipathon.
The user_analog_project_wrapper_topCell.gds contains a rough floorplan of the proposed contributions, which totals about 4 mm2. These standalone fixtures are intended to be cut from a sacrificial die as part of a larger study on RF interconnections.
